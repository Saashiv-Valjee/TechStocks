# ðŸ“Š Quant Research Project: AI & Semiconductor Stocks

## ðŸ§  Project Focus
This project explores quantitative signals in the AI hardware and semiconductor sector, focusing on the relative performance and predictive features of key companies directly tied to the AI supply chain.

### âœ… Core Tickers
- **Nvidia (NVDA)** â€“ Leading AI GPU manufacturer
- **AMD (AMD)** â€“ GPU/CPU competitor to Nvidia
- **TSMC (TSM)** â€“ World's largest chip foundry (Nvidia supplier)
- **Supermicro (SMCI)** â€“ AI server manufacturer
- **iShares SOXX ETF (SOXX)** â€“ Semiconductor index benchmark

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

### Phase 1: Setup & Data Pipeline
- [x] Set up Python environment using Conda
- [x] Install packages: `yfinance`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- [x] Retrieve historical daily data for all tickers using Yahoo Finance
- [x] Align, clean, and merge into a unified time series DataFrame

---

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering
- [ ] Compute N-day log returns for N = 5, 10, 21
- [ ] Calculate 20-day **rolling Z-scores** of returns to normalize momentum
- [ ] Implement Relative Strength Index (RSI) for each ticker
- [ ] Track Nvidiaâ€™s **outperformance vs AMD/TSMC/SOXX** over time

---

### Phase 3: Signal Construction
- [ ] Define simple alpha signals:
  - Go long Nvidia if its 10-day return z-score > AMD & TSMC
  - Go long Nvidia if it outperforms SOXX by > 1.5%
- [ ] Construct signal time series for backtesting

---

### Phase 4: Backtest and Evaluation
- [ ] Build simple backtester for daily rebalancing
- [ ] Calculate performance metrics:
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Max Drawdown
  - Equity Curve vs Benchmark (SOXX)
- [ ] Plot signal vs returns scatterplots and trend heatmaps

---

### Phase 5: Insights and Strategy Development
- [ ] Identify strongest lead/lag relationships
- [ ] Test cross-correlation: Does NVDA lead AMD or vice versa?
- [ ] Propose simple rules-based trading strategy based on findings

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook / VSCode
- Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Optional: `backtrader`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`

---

## ðŸ”­ Stretch Goals
